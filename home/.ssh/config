  # Stop offering all public keys to servers.
  #
  # By default, ssh sends all public keys to a server whenever it tries to
  # authenticate. To avoid this behavior, set `PubkeyAuthentication` and
  # `ItentiesOnly`.

  #
  # Disable public key authentication by default.
  #
  # Even with `IdentitiesOnly yes`, the default ssh identities are still sent
  # to the server. The default is ~/.ssh/identity for protocol version 1, and
  # some combination (depending on the system) of ~/.ssh/id_dsa,
  # ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa, ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 and ~/.ssh/id_rsa for protocol
  # version 2.
  #
  # Disabling PubkeyAuthentication prevents this, and then
  # PubkeyAuthentication can be reenabled for each host. Example:
  #     Host example.com
  #       PubkeyAuthentication yes
  PubkeyAuthentication no
  # Ignore ssh-agent keys.
  #
  # Host-specific keys can be included in the individual `Host` section. Example:
  #     Host example.com
  #       IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_example
  IdentitiesOnly yes
