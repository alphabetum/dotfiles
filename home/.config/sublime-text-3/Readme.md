# Sublime Text 3

This configuration for Sublime Text 3 is compatible with both Linux and macOS.

Only some of the files are tracked in the `bindle` git repository, but the
additional files will be generated by Sublime Text 3 at runtime.

This location within the `.config` directory is already the default for Linux,
but macOS will require this directory be symlinked from
`~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3`. This should be accomplished
using the following command:

    bindle customize sublime-text-3

This will run the script found in
[`$BINDLE_PATH/script/customize/sublime-text-3`
