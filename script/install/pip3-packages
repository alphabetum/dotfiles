# ftfy - fixes text for you
#
# Given Unicode text, make its representation consistent and possibly less
# broken.
#
# The goal of ftfy is to take in bad Unicode and output good Unicode, for
# use in your Unicode-aware code. This is different from taking in non-Unicode
# and outputting Unicode, which is not a goal of ftfy. It also isn’t designed
# to protect you from having to write Unicode-aware code. ftfy helps those who
# help themselves.
